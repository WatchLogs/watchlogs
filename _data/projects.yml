#   description: "A love story told through Fitbit data. The increasing amount of data that describes our lives still leaves gaps that are impossible to fill without a human there to fill them. This is one attempt to take control of my data, substantiating it with a real life, intensely personal story. This all started because I wanted to get a better idea of my sleep cycles."

  description: "Current status: super buggy. But still proud of the code and concept: search for items that other users nearby have posted that they are willing to lend for a small fee. Borrow and lend stuff like photography gear, drones, smart watches, and other expensive tech gear. You get to try something cool without having to outright buy it. It's my envisioning of a true 'sharing economy.'"
