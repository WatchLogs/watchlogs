Hi! I'm Steph. I am a writer and web developer based in San Francisco. This site is a recent effort to consolidate all of the writing I've published in disparate places over the past five years. It covers everything from my experiences backpacking around South America (2012) to some reporting I did in Brooklyn (2011) all the way to more recent writings on design, algorithms, and Stoicism (2015-16). These days I think a lot about the relationship between technology and humanity. Specifically, how does technology, something we as humans create, unintentionally affect us? As AI becomes a more prominent fixture in our everyday lives, what will our future begin to look like? And most importantly, in what ways can we use technology to improve ourselves and the lives of others?</p>

<p>When I'm not at a computer, I like to exercise, cook, and ride my bike. Sometimes I draw, paint, and play the piano and drums. I geek out over architecture, fitness, and nutrition. I try to meditate every day. I listen to way too many podcasts.</p>

<p>This is what I look like.</p>
