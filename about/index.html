Hi! I'm Steph. I am a writer and web developer based in San Francisco. I like to think and write about the relationship between technology and  humanity. How does technology improve or worsen our lives? What will our future look like? In what ways can we use technology to improve our lives and the lives of others?</p>

<p>I love to write, exercise, cook, and ride my bike. Sometimes I draw, paint, and play the piano and drums. I geek out over architecture, fitness, and nutrition.</p>

<p>This is what I look like.</p>
