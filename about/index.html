Hi! I'm Steph. I am a writer and web developer based in San Francisco. I'm interested in the relationship between humanity and technology. More specifically, how will technology shape our future? In what ways can we create and leverage technology to improve our lives?</p>

<p>I love to write, exercise, cook, and ride my bike. Sometimes I draw, paint, and play the piano and drums. I geek out over architecture, fitness, and nutrition.</p>

<p>This is what I look like.</p>
