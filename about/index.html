Hi! I'm Steph. I am a writer and web developer based in San Francisco. I tend to write about the relationship between technology and humanity, always asking: how does technology affect us? What will our future look like? In what ways can we use technology to improve ourselves and the lives of others?</p>

<p>When I'm not at a computer, I like to exercise, cook, and ride my bike. Sometimes I draw, paint, and play the piano and drums. I geek out over architecture, fitness, and nutrition. I try to meditate every day. I listen to way too many podcasts.</p>

<p>This is what I look like.</p>
