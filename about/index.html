<p>
I am a writer and web developer based in San Francisco. This site is a recent effort to consolidate everything I've posted in disparate places over the past five years. It covers everything from reporting in Brooklyn (2011) to backpacking in South America (2012) all the way to more recent writings on design, data viz, and technology (2015-present).</p><br>

<p>More broadly, though, this is where some of my thoughts go. To quote sociologist C. Wright Mills's book <em>The Sociological Imagination</em>:<br>

<p style="padding-left:10px">"As a social scientist, you have to...capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a file.</p>

<br><p style="padding-left:10px">"In such a file...there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned. In this file, you will try to get together what you are doing intellectually and what you are experiencing as a person. Here you will not be afraid to use your experience and relate it directly to various work in progress. By serving as a check on repetitious work, your file also enables you to conserve your energy. It also encourages you to capture ‘fringe-thoughts’: various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life, snatches of conversation overheard in the street, or, for that matter, dreams. Once noted, these may lead to more systematic thinking, as well as lend intellectual relevance to more directed experience."</p>


<p>I use this blog as my digital file.</p>

<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>I built this site on the Jekyll framework with HTML, Markdown, Sass, YAML, and Javascript. It is served freely by Github Pages. The design is customized but based off of the <a href="https://github.com/getmicah/blog" target="_blank">Basic</a> Jekyll theme.</p>
