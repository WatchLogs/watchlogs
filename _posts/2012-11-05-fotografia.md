Presenting you with the first few photos of Colombia that I’ve (surreptitiously) taken with my iPhone. I hope to break out my DSLR soon enough, but for now, just wanted to quickly give you an idea of the things I’ve been seeing so far:

New Yorkers, do these look familiar? Hint: If you’ve been to the Time Warner Center, they should! Sculptures by native Medellín-ian (need to work on that descriptor) Fernando Botero, located in the San Antonio park located downtown. I remember seeing this NYT article: http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/an-attention-getter-irresistibly-interactive/ when it was published…at the time I never would have thought I’d actually see more “Boterismo” work, in Botero’s native city no less! I  love how unabashedly ridiculous his works are.

My first meal out. Really delicious, lots of food and juice, and only came to 8,000 pesos ($4.30)!

Partido de futbol that I stumbled upon (free admission). I love watching soccer, but I was definitely more interested in the incredible views from the stadium than anything else.

And finally, the metro, which can get you pretty much anywhere you want to go in the city. It’s the only metro system in the country and played a major role in the revitalization of Medellín.
