DRAFT

There is a new paradigm for how we interact with technology that will replace (or at least supplement) internet and mobile device browsing : intelligent assistants. Some consider this the next thing after web and mobile - intelligent machines that recognize your voice, and with whom you can speak or send messages. They will be able to learn your preferences, feed you information, play you music, send you reminders, book dinner and travel reservations, and more. Tech companies large and small are racing to develop intelligent assistants that will become a big part of your life.
