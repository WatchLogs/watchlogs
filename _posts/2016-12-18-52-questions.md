<p>
Starting in 2017, each week for 52 consecutive weeks I will ask a question, and use data and programming to attempt to answer it.</p>

A few questions on my mind I'd like to explore:

<ul>
  <li><h3>In real estate listings, what is the relationship between language (and by extension, sentiment) and factors such as price, location, time of year, and identity of real estate agent.</h3>
  	<p>My hypothesis is that the real estate agent is the most influential factor in language usage, but beyond that, that there is a negative correlation between cost and adjective count. In other words, language serves as a compensatory force for lackluster listings. Think of the use of words like "charming" and "rustic" that really mean "dilapidated" and "old."" </p></li><br>
  <li><h4>How are our brains changing in response to the increasing amount of information we encounter in the world?</h4>
  	<p>It is well known that our brains have changed/are changing due to the volume of information we are exposed to and forced to process each day. My question is more about the degree, intensity, and nuances of such a change. How much have brains changed? And how long does it take to discern differences via brain scans, etc.? And how are these changes affecting our every day lives?) </p>
