<p>
Starting in 2017, each week for 52 consecutive weeks I will ask a question, and use data and programming to attempt to answer it.</p>

A few questions on my mind I'd like to explore:

<ul>
  <li><h3>1. In real estate listings, what is the relationship between language (and by extension, sentiment) and factors such as price, location, time of year, and identity of real estate agent.</h3>
  	<p>My hypothesis is that the real estate agent is the most influential factor in language usage, but beyond that, that there is a negative correlation between cost and adjective count. In other words, language serves as a compensatory force for lackluster listings. Think of the use of words like "charming" and "rustic" that really mean "dilapidated" and "old."" </p></li>
  <li>2. </li>
  <li>3. </li>
</ul>
