Since I learned to code, I've encountered dozens of concepts and tools that make the job of coding easier and more effective. However, many of these concepts and tools could also be used by non-prorammers, or for non-programming tasks, and the only reason they aren't is because there's a wall around them, considered only within the domain and know-how of the "technical" few. This is wrong.

To address this, I plan on covering a few of those concepts in this blog. I want to provide how-to guides for applying programming concepts and using programming tools for non-programming goals. I've noticed a divide (completely contrived, but still) in the working world between those who can code and those who cannot. One way this butts its head is in the job search in San Francisco, frequently divided between "technical" and "non-technical" jobs. This is a false dichotomy. The reality is that many non-technical jobs require a signicant amount of technical know-how. You may not be asked to write code, but in my experience, even in a standard office job you are expected to know--on day one--exactly how to navigate a file system, download, upload, transfer files (FTP or otherwise), and communicate online (which requires a different skill set from communicating offline). In other words, there are a great deal of technical skills taken for granted in the average modern-day office worker, and there are skills lumped into the "technical" that are easy to learn and wildly useful, even for "non-technical" tasks.

Over the next few posts I will cover some of these concepts; the first will be how to use the command line. Before I learned how to code, I learned how to use the Terminal, and it's made not only the task of coding but also the more general task of using a computer much easier, faster, and more intuitive. I remember fearing the command line before I knew anything about it. And certainly there is some learning curve, but it's not as steep as one might think, and soon using the CLI will become second nature to you as it has for me. 

For this series, I will cover the minimum effective dose: enough to cover 80% of what the CLI can do for the average programmer and enough that will maximize your ability to navigate your computer and file system. There are plenty of tutorials online that can take you much deeper if you are interested, but my goal is to cover enough to maximize utility for the average user. Stay tuned!
