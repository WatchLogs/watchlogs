Faithful readers,

My apologies for taking such a long blog hiatus.  Here are some photos of my travels lately:

Path leading up to the place I stayed in Guatape, about a 2-hour bus ride east of Medellin:

View of La Piedra (Piedra de Penol) on our hike

650+ stairs to the top

And then we went “Puenting” or “Bridging,” in San Rafael. Puenting is like bungee jumping in that you are connected to a rope via harness, and you free-fall from great heights. It differs that instead of bouncing up and down once you reach bottom, you instead form a big swinging arc with your jump (the physics of which I still don’t understand) and just fly back and forth until you release yourself into the water.Getting psyched up by some Colombian soldiers

Confronted with the possibility of death, and this is the face I make

The release

No good shots of me on the way down, so one of Greg instead

And finally, a shot of a Colombian soldier jumping. Not only did a group of soldiers come spectate Puenting for the better part of a day, one of them actually chose to jump with us. And ironically, he could not figure out how to release himself from the harness at the bottom of his jump. Only in Colombia.

Plenty more photos to come, but the upload process here is painfully slow and I need to get going for now. Photo post part 2 coming soon.
