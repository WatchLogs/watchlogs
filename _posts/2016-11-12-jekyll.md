Hello, world (again). I grew increasingly unsatisfied with the WYSIWYG-iness of Wordpress. I felt locked in to too many gratuitous features, and without the ability to easily customize and control content and design. So I'm moving on over to the more developer-friendly Jekyll for hosting and publishing my blog. And let it be known, I'm already having a lot more fun. I'll be transferring my old content over here with its original publish date, and then will continue publishing new content as usual.
