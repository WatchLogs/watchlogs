<h2>How To Bring Your Wordpress Site to Jekyll</h2>

<p>Hello, world (again). I grew increasingly unsatisfied with the WYSIWYG-iness of Wordpress. I felt locked in to too many gratuitous features, and without the ability to easily customize and control content and design. There are advanced workarounds, to be sure, but I wanted to try something new. So I decided to move all my content over to the more developer-friendly Jekyll for hosting and publishing my blog. And let it be known, I'm already having a lot of fun. I'll be transferring my old content over here with its original publish date, and then will continue publishing new content as usual. I also hope to write a guide on how to make the conversion from Wordpress to Jekyll yourself so you too can customize and iterate as much as your little developer heart desires.</p>
