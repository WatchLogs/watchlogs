title: Hello, world (again)
---

Hello, world! I grew increasingly frustrated unsatisfied with the WYSIWYG-iness of Wordpress, so I'm moving on over to the more developer-friendly Jekyll for hosting and publishing my blog. And let it be known, I'm already having a lot more fun. I'll be transferring my old content over here with its original publish date, and then will continue publishing new content as usual.
