Prospect Heights residents have their choice of events to celebrate Black History Month.

Brooklyn's  in Prospect Heights is offering the most events, with more than a dozen throughout February.

“The Brooklyn Public Library concentrates on programs that highlight the cultural, political, and personal impacts of Americans of African descent,” said Meredith Walters, director of adult programming at the Central Library.

"Many of our patrons are new Americans, so it's great to share the achievements of past Americans with people who are beginning their (own) journeys as Americans," she said.

The library will host three events on  W.E.B. Du Bois alone. Walters chose the civil rights activist, author and intellectual as this year's focus "because he is an American who made an impact in so many disciplines and on so many fronts, and his ideas still resonate in contemporary society."
